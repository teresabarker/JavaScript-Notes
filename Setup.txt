Setup Notes
For when I inevitably forget and need to help someone get setup from scratch in the future

Getting your first JavaScript program to run from scratch in Visual Studio code:
Step 1:
Install Visual Studio Code from here https://code.visualstudio.com/

Step 2:
Create a new project, following the VSCode prompt

Step 3:
Create a file, perhaps the OG HelloWorld.JavaScript

Step 4: 
Type the following into your new fancy file: console.log("Hello World!");
Do you need the semicolon? No. Should you still put it? Always

Step 5:
Install Node.js and npm from here https://nodejs.org/en/
I did the LTS (Long Term Support) version

Step 6:
Check that Node.js and npm installed correctly by typing the following into a new terminal and make sure it spits out the version:
node -v
npm -v

Step 7: 
Run your program!
Can do this a few different ways:
You can press the play button inside of Visual Studio Code and check that it outputs things down below
Or, in that terminal you have open, you can cd to where your HelloWorld.js file lives and type node HelloWorld.js

Good stuff :)
